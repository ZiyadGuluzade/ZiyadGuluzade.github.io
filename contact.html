                    Hi, I am Ziyad and this my very first real webpage. I am new to web-development, so please don't judge me hard if you find any mistakes in this webpage. I'd like to use this platform in order to introduce myself to you. I am originally from a very small and young country called Azerbaijan. Probably, you have never heard of it. That is okay. In fact almost everyone who ask me about my background get very confused when they hear it. My hometown is Baku. It is also the capital of Azerbaijan. Check the portfolio and you'll see how beautiful my hometown is. I have a bachelor's degree in tourism and hotel business. Honestly, I wasn't enjoing the whole tourism industry from the very first day. It is one of those reasons why decide to switch over web-development.<br>
                    I do love traveling and outdoor activities especially soccer. Unfortunately, I didn't travel to many countries but hopefully one day I will. I have aslo included a travel photos to my portfolio. I want to give you a friednly advice. Never travel to Dubai in summer! Never! It is very hot out there, especially during summer. February is the perfecet to be there. Make sure you
